# ANN-Classification-Churn
This project predicts bank customer churn using machine learning. The dataset includes customer demographics, account info, and churn status. Data is preprocessed (encoding, scaling), then split for training/testing. An artificial neural network is trained to classify churn, and TensorBoard is used for model evaluation and visualization.
